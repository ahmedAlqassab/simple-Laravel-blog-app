This is a simple laravel project that i created to show my ability in creating dynamic websites.

this project is a simple blog website called myblog. in this project i am using bootstrap styling and mysql database.

there is also a simple authentication feature added.

the project is deployed on heroku's free hosting so some changes had to be made to make it work with the free service.
